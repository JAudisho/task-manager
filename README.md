# Task Manager Pro
Welcome to Task Manager Pro, a next-level task management app that combines AI, voice commands, and a stunning dynamic interface to help you organize your life. I designed this project to stand out from other task managers, incorporating features that are both super useful and fun to use.

## Features
Here‚Äôs what makes Task Manager Pro awesome:

1. Dynamic Background:

- The app has a cool gradient animation combined with particle effects for a futuristic look. It‚Äôs like your tasks are floating in space!
2. AI-Powered Task Assignment:

- When you type a task, the app‚Äôs AI assigns a category (like Work, Personal, or Urgent) and sets a priority based on the task's urgency or importance.
3. Voice Commands:

- You can use your voice to add tasks, mark them complete, or search for specific ones. Just click the üé§ button and start talking‚Äîno typing needed!
4. Subtasks:

- Each task can have smaller subtasks, so breaking down big goals is easier than ever.
5. Pomodoro Timer:

- Focus on one task at a time with the built-in timer. It even sends notifications when your session is over.
6. Search and Advanced Filters:

- Search tasks by keywords or filter them by category, priority, or completion status. It‚Äôs quick and keeps everything organized.
7. Calendar View:

- Tasks with due dates appear in a calendar, making it easy to plan your week or month.
8. Gamification:

- Earn points for completing tasks and unlock achievements for milestones like ‚Äú10 High Priority Tasks Completed.‚Äù It makes getting stuff done way more fun!
9. Light and Dark Mode:

- Switch between light and dark themes depending on your mood or time of day. It‚Äôs sleek and easy on the eyes.
10. Export and Import Tasks:

- Export your tasks to a file or import them from another device. Perfect for when you‚Äôre on the go.
